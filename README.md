# uke-sensors

Uke sensor discovery, typed evidence and native userspace integration for Xiaomi Pad 7 / POCO Pad X1 (`uke`, SM7675).

This is an initial project-owned source and packaging repository. The manifest
lists the intended packages, Uke evidence gates and current build readiness.
There is no functional hardware payload or device acceptance at this checkpoint.

## Package scope

- `uke-sensors`

Nabu reference families: `nabu-sensors`.
These are process references; Uke wiring, firmware and runtime behavior require
independent implementation and validation.

## Required validation

- Review Uke LSM6DSO, STK3BCx, SIP1328, QMC630x and SX937x sources.
- Prove SSC transport and per-profile sensor wiring.
- Calibrated measurement and IIO/desktop acceptance.

The first packaging target is Fedora Rawhide AArch64 in
[uke-linux-test COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mcc45tr/uke-linux-test/).
DEB and Alpine APK targets require their own native rules later.
Unimplemented targets fail explicitly rather than producing placeholder RPMs.

Use `make validate` to check this repository's manifest contract. Native device
applications use C++; upstream C/assembly interfaces retain their original
languages. Host automation uses Bash or Make. Python does not enter tablet
payloads. Source archives belong in `referances/`, development in `src/`.
Public records exclude personal paths, unit identifiers and calibration data.

See [the roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), [source policy](docs/SOURCE-POLICY.md) and
[manifest](manifests/component.json). New material findings are recorded in
`docs/lessons/`; source, package, emulation and physical evidence stay distinct.
