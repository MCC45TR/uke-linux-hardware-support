# plasma-uke-kcm

Native C++/Qt Plasma controls for measured Uke hardware interfaces for Xiaomi Pad 7 / POCO Pad X1 (`uke`, SM7675).

This is an initial project-owned source and packaging repository. The manifest
lists the intended packages, Uke evidence gates and current build readiness.
There is no functional hardware payload or device acceptance at this checkpoint.

## Package scope

- `plasma-uke-kcm`

Nabu reference families: `plasma-nabu-kcm`.
These are process references; Uke wiring, firmware and runtime behavior require
independent implementation and validation.

## Required validation

- Design capabilities from Uke driver evidence.
- Show unavailable features explicitly.
- Validate with Plasma and separately on the tablet.

The first packaging target is Fedora Rawhide AArch64 in
[uke-linux-test COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mcc45tr/uke-linux-test/).
DEB and Alpine APK targets require their own native rules later.
Unimplemented targets fail explicitly rather than producing placeholder RPMs.

Use `make validate` to check this repository's manifest contract. Native device
applications use C++; upstream C/assembly interfaces retain their original
languages. Host automation uses Bash or Make. Python does not enter tablet
payloads. Source archives belong in `referances/`, development in `src/`.
Public records exclude personal paths, unit identifiers and calibration data.

See [the roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), [source policy](docs/SOURCE-POLICY.md) and
[manifest](manifests/component.json). New material findings are recorded in
`docs/lessons/`; source, package, emulation and physical evidence stay distinct.
