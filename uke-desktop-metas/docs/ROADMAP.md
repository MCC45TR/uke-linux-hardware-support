# Initial Uke roadmap

1. Inventory the named Nabu reference families and pin relevant upstream sources.
2. Establish Uke-specific interfaces, licenses and firmware profile boundaries.
3. Implement the intended packages and complete these gates:

- Validate kernel/boot and console before desktop admission.
- Resolve closure on target AArch64.
- Preserve stock KDE behavior unless a measured Uke issue requires a change.

4. Build and audit AArch64 RPM/SRPM payloads and their complete dependency closure.
5. Test installation, upgrade and removal in an isolated target environment.
6. Publish accepted development candidates to COPR, then collect distinct physical
   results using a preserved stock/recovery route.

The initial repository validates structure and intent only. It claims no build,
boot, peripheral or physical acceptance.

## 2026-10-05 source implementation

Real source/RPM rules now exist. Source validation and local package inspection
are separate from native COPR, target transaction and physical acceptance.
The development package does not claim the initial hardware gates are complete.
