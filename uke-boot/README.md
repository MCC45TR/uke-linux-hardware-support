# Uke boot integration

Image input templates and a native read-only boot prerequisite inspector for
Xiaomi Pad 7 / POCO Pad X1 (`uke`, SM7675).

`uke-boot-integration` supplies the `uke_esp`/`uke_linux` role contract, EXT4/FAT
fstab template, kernel command line and portable dracut settings. A host image
composer must apply them explicitly. Package installation does not change
fstab, generate an initramfs, select a boot entry, modify EFI variables or write
Android partitions. It includes no UEFI or proprietary firmware binary.

`uke-boot-status` inspects the current EFI presence, exact Uke compatible strings,
selected kernel release and root command line without writing. `--root` supports
an extracted inspection fixture. Exit 2 reports missing prerequisites. Positive
observations do not grant storage, peripheral or physical acceptance.

The independent Uke UEFI port, exact firmware RAM handoff, UFS DT/binding support,
measured partition geometry and Android return remain separate prerequisites.
Nabu binary/geometry defaults cannot supply them. Detailed records are in
[private engineering documentation](https://github.com/MCC45TR/uke-linux-docs).

Run `make validate`, `make test-native` or `make srpm`. Source archives remain in
`referances/`; package/host output is ignored under `build/`.

The host-only `src/audit-kernel-inputs.sh EXTRACTED_ROOT REPORT_JSON` checks the
installed kernel configuration and exact Uke DTB, traverses enabled nodes and
records static RAM, UFS and firmware requests. It requires Bash, jq and the
device-tree-compiler utilities. Exit 2 records incomplete static inputs; a
future verified UEFI RAM fixup needs independent evidence. This host audit is
excluded from the binary package. Synthetic fixtures also reject firmware
requests below disabled parents and foreign device trees.
